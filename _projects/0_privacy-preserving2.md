title:  "Privacy-preserving camera localization via feature augmentation (2023.01 - 2024.02)"
---
  
Developing core algorithms for 3D reconstruction and camera localization that can address user's privacy concerns.
  
<br/>

### Problems in previous works
* Privacy threat is possible when a client's image query is leaked while image queries are being sent to a localization server
  + Concern query (or clien)-side privacy issues  
  + Even with feature points and feature descriptors depicting an original image, the image can be restored with high quality ([Dangwal et al., BMVC 2021]()) which results privacy threats  
  + Several approaches are given to avoid this scenario, but not practical
    1. 2D feature points -> 2D feature lines, ([Speciale et al., ICCV 2019]())
        - ...  
    2. Lifting feature descriptors to higher dimension, ([Dusmanu et al., CVPR 2021]())  
        - ...
    3. ([Pittaluga et al., ICCV 2023]())
